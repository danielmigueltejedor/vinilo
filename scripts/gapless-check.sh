# Watch the sidecar's audio stream across a track boundary.
#
# Gapless has two halves and this measures the one your ears cannot.
#
#   1. Rust must not drive the queue. `RUST_LOG=vinilo=info` prints a
#      "track transition" line at every boundary saying what prompted it.
#      A natural boundary must read `prompted_by="nothing — MusicKit
#      advanced itself"`. Anything else means Rust is feeding tracks one at
#      a time and rule 3 is broken.
#
#   2. The decoder must not stop. That is this script. If the PipeWire
#      stream is torn down and rebuilt at the boundary, there is a gap no
#      matter what the log says — you will see `removed` then `new`.
#      A gapless transition keeps one stream alive throughout.
#
# Neither replaces listening. Both tell you *where* a gap came from.
#
# NOTE ON CLOCKS: the timestamps below are local time; `tracing` logs UTC.
# The header prints the offset so the two logs can be lined up — the first
# run of this script cost a few minutes to working out that a "gap" two
# hours adrift was in fact a screenshot shutter.

# Which sink-input belongs to Vinilo. Matched on any property containing the
# name, because Chromium spreads it across application.name,
# application.process.binary and media.name depending on the version — and
# `app.setName('Vinilo')` in sidecar/main.js is what puts it there at all.
#
# This filter is the point: a notification sound or a screenshot shutter opens
# and closes its own short-lived stream, and reporting those as gaps makes the
# whole instrument untrustworthy.
