# What Vinilo costs the machine it runs on: memory, CPU, and disk.
#
# There is no single number, and the obvious one is wrong. Vinilo is a Rust
# process supervising a Chromium, and Chromium is six or seven processes that
# share most of their pages. Adding up RSS counts that shared memory once per
# process and roughly doubles the answer, which is how a browser engine gets
# reported as costing a gigabyte it is not using.
#
# So this reports **PSS** — proportional set size, where a page shared by four
# processes counts a quarter in each. It is the number that answers "how much
# would I get back if this quit", which is the question being asked.
#
# CPU matters here for a specific reason rather than a general one: two bugs in
# this app's history pinned a core (#37's runaway reducer, and the `#[watch]`
# animation that had to be diagnosed from a core dump). Both would have shown up
# here instantly.
#
# Idle should now read near zero. It did not when this script was written — the
# backdrop drifted on an `infinite` CSS animation, so the frame clock never
# stopped and a fifth of a core went into repainting a still window. That was
# the first thing this script found (#126, fixed in #128), which is the argument
# for having it.
#
#   scripts/footprint.sh          # measure a running Vinilo
#   scripts/footprint.sh --disk   # disk only, no instance needed
#
# Start Vinilo first. Play something before measuring if you want the playing
# figure — a decoder that has never decoded is not the working set.

# Two names, because there are now two processes worth measuring. The GTK client
# owns its GApplication name; whichever process is exporting the player owns the
# MPRIS one — the client when it runs alone, the daemon otherwise. Asking for
# both and de-duplicating is what makes this work before *and* after the client
# becomes a client of the daemon, when both will be running at once.
