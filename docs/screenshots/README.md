# Screenshots

What the top-level README expects to find here, and what each shot should show.

`icon.png` is **generated, not captured** — it is the app's own SVG rendered at
128px, so it can never drift from what the app actually installs:

```bash
cp data/icons/hicolor/128x128/apps/dev.danielmiguelt.Vinilo.png docs/screenshots/icon.png
```

## The shots

| File | Shows |
| --- | --- |
| `library.webp` | Listen Now — recently played, Made for You, the Now Playing bar |
| `player.webp` | The expanded player: artwork, transport, lyrics |
| `playlist.webp` | A playlist page: Play and Shuffle, tracks |
| `albums.webp` | A Spotify playlist — the same shell on another source |

## Taking them

- **Dark theme**, since that is what the app looks like on a default GNOME
  install and what every shot here uses.
- Capture the **window, not the screen** — `Alt`+`PrtSc`. GNOME's shadow and
  rounded corners come along with it, which is what makes a GTK4 app look like
  one.
- Play something first, and keep the *same* track across the set. A Now Playing
  bar reading "Nothing playing" undersells every screenshot it appears in, and a
  different track in each one reads as four unrelated apps.
- Avoid a half-loaded state: no spinners, no placeholder covers.
- Show what is *new*. A shot that could have been taken three versions ago is a
  wasted one.

## Processing

Resize to 1600px wide, then pick a format **by what is in the picture**:

```bash
# UI and text — lossless, so glyphs stay crisp
magick shot.png -resize 1600x -strip \
  -define webp:lossless=true -define webp:method=6 docs/screenshots/library.webp

# Mostly album art — lossy, since lossless gains nothing and costs 4x
magick shot.png -resize 1600x -strip \
  -quality 92 -define webp:method=6 docs/screenshots/albums.webp
```

Keep each one under ~500 KB. If one is stubborn, `-resize 1400x` first — nobody
reads a README at full resolution.
