//! The line to the daemon.

//! **One connection, subscribed, treated as a stream.** Requests go out and
//! events come back; the answer to a request arrives as an event like any
//! other, and nothing is paired up. That is not a simplification — a subscribed
//! connection has broadcasts queued in it, so "write a request, read the next
//! line" returns whichever event happened to be waiting rather than the answer.
//! Learned by watching a probe report that nothing worked while the daemon was
//! perfectly fine.
