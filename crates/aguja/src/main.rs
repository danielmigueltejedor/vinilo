//! `aguja` — Winamp 2.x for Apple Music, in a terminal.
//!
//! A client of `vinilod` and nothing more: it draws what the daemon says and
//! sends what the keyboard asks for. **No key changes what is on screen** — a
//! press becomes a request, and the screen moves when the daemon answers. That
//! is rule 3 reaching the third layer, and it is what keeps a terminal and a
//! GTK window from disagreeing about what is playing.
//!
//! **It needs a graphical session.** Not for itself — for the Chromium the
//! daemon runs, which wants a display server even with its window hidden. That
//! is Widevine, not a shortcut, and it is why this cannot run over plain SSH.
