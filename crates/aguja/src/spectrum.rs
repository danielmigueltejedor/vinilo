//! The bars: what the audio actually looks like.
//!
//! **It listens rather than being told.** aguja never touches the audio — the
//! sidecar owns the stream — so this reads a monitor source, the loopback every
//! output exposes. That is how `cava` and every other visualiser works, and it
//! means the bars follow whatever is playing, including a track the GTK window
//! started.
//!
//! **Asking for one stream is not enough, on PipeWire.**
//! `pa_stream_set_monitor_stream` narrows a record stream to a single
//! sink-input, and it is asked for here — measured, the record stream's
//! `target.object` really is the sidecar's sink-input. `pipewire-pulse` does
//! not honour it: with Vinilo paused and silent and another application
//! playing, the bars still moved. Real PulseAudio does, so the request stays.
//!
//! What actually keeps a notification chime out of the bars is the player's own
//! state — `aguja` draws them only while Vinilo is playing. That leaves one
//! case unhandled and it is the honest one to leave: while Vinilo *is*
//! playing, whatever else the machine makes is mixed into what we read. Fixing
//! that properly means PipeWire's own API rather than its PulseAudio emulation,
//! which is a different dependency and a different backend.
//!
//! **PulseAudio, not PipeWire.** PipeWire ships `pipewire-pulse` and reports
//! itself as `PulseAudio (on PipeWire …)`, so one backend covers both servers
//! and every distro running either. `@DEFAULT_MONITOR@` is resolved by the
//! server, so this follows the default sink rather than pinning a device that
//! stops existing when somebody unplugs their headphones.
