//! Volume, where the rest of the desktop keeps it.
//!
//! **Not MusicKit's.** The player has a volume of its own, and driving that
//! left two independent gains for one application: Vinilo's slider said 50%
//! while the system mixer said 100%, they multiplied, and only one of them was
//! where a Linux user goes to look. This drives the *stream* instead — the
//! sink-input the sidecar is playing through — so Vinilo's volume and the one
//! in the desktop's audio panel are the same number.
//!
//! **Persistence is the audio server's job, not ours.** The stream disappears
//! whenever playback stops for a while, which would otherwise mean tracking a
//! desired volume and re-applying it on every new stream. `module-stream-restore`
//! already does exactly that, keyed on `sink-input-by-application-name:Vinilo`
//! — verified by setting 40%, stopping until the stream went away, and starting
//! again to find it still at 40%.
