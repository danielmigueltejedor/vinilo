//! Putting playback back when MusicKit does not do what it was asked.
//!
//! Three separate failures, each found the hard way in the GTK client and each
//! costing a silent dead player if it is missed:
//!
//! * a `play` that completes and produces no audio,
//! * a queue that opens on a track other than the one that was named,
//! * a position lost to the reload that fixed the first two.
