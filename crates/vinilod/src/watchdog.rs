//! Noticing a sidecar that is alive and not working.
//!
//! Rule 6 supervises a sidecar that *dies*. This is the other half: one that
//! stays up and stops playing. Found after a 13-hour suspend — every signal
//! said healthy (ten Electron processes, `stage: ready`, `playing: true`) while
//! MusicKit answered no commands, reported the same position for twelve hours,
//! and had no PipeWire stream at all. `play` was correctly ignored, because as
//! far as the daemon knew it was already playing.
//!
//! The tell is free: the daemon already reads a reported position twice a
//! second, and a player that claims to be playing must move it.
