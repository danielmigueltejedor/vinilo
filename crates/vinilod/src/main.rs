//! `vinilod` — the half of Vinilo that owns the sidecar.
//!
//! **A daemon because the sidecar is a singleton, not because daemons are
//! nice.** One Widevine CDM, one `persist:vinilo` partition, one Chromium
//! profile lock: two processes cannot each run one. So if a terminal client and
//! a GTK window are ever to coexist, exactly one process holds the sidecar and
//! the rest are clients of it.
//!
//! Single-threaded on purpose. `mpris_server::Player` is `!Send`, the sidecar's
//! stdout reader is a local stream, and there is nothing here worth a thread
//! pool — this process waits on I/O, it does not compute.
