//! Newline-delimited JSON over a Unix socket, the same shape as the sidecar's

//! request and its handler cannot drift apart across a release.
//!
//! **Field names are snake_case, tag values are camelCase.** The fields match

//! **The client sends intent, never state.** `vinilod` owns the sidecar and
//! the mirror; a frontend asks for things and is told what happened. That is
//! rule 3 one hop further out — MusicKit owns the queue, the daemon mirrors it,
//! and clients mirror the daemon.
