//! Locate, spawn and supervise the Electron child.
//!
//! This is the piece Dockyard and Pitwall never needed. Both talked to
//! something that already existed (a socket, an API); Vinilo *owns a process*.
//! So the module's job is lifetime: start it, read its stdout forever, notice
//! when it dies, and let `app/mod.rs` restart it (CLAUDE.md rule 6).
//!
//! ## Ownership note (Rust, for a React brain)
//!
//! The child's stdin and stdout are two halves that need to live in different
//! places: stdout is read by a background task that runs for as long as the
//! process does, while stdin is written to from `update()` in response to
//! clicks. We can't hand both to one owner without making every send `await` a
//! lock, so we split them:
//!
//!   - stdout is *moved* into a spawned tokio task that owns it outright;
//!   - stdin is *moved* into a second task fed by an unbounded channel.
//!
//! `Handle` then holds only a channel sender, which is cheap to clone and
//! `Send` — that's why the UI can keep one in the model and clone it into
//! closures without a `Mutex` anywhere. The channel *is* the synchronisation.
