//! Rule 3 lives here: MusicKit owns the queue and we mirror it, so a click
//! sends the **whole** visible list in one `setQueue` and names its starting
//! track **by id**. Nearly every function below exists because some earlier
//! version carried an *index* across a filter, a network round trip or a user
//! action — and started the wrong song.
//!
//! Nothing here draws anything or holds a model: it is the arithmetic a
//! frontend and the daemon both have to get right, and getting it right twice
//! is how they would come to disagree.
