//! The library, kept between runs so the app opens on it.
//!
//! Measured before this existed: ~1.5s of sidecar boot, then ~1.5s of fetching
//! 534 songs that had not changed since the last launch — about 3.2s of spinner
//! every time. The songs, albums, artists and playlists are all rederivable
//! (Apple will tell us again), so this is a **cache**, beside `unplayable.json`
//! and the artwork, and never `$XDG_STATE_HOME`.
//!
//! Read tolerantly and written best-effort: losing it costs one slow launch.
//! Catalog ids and album titles are not secrets, so rule 7 is not engaged —
//! there is nothing here that would matter if someone read the file.
