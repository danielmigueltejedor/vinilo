/// already in memory, sorting 500 of them is instant, and `/me/library/songs`
/// offers no sort parameter worth a round trip anyway.
///
/// **Here rather than in a client** because two of them need it now — the GTK
/// app sorts the cache it reads itself, and the daemon sorts what it serves
/// over `browse`. One set of comparators, so two frontends cannot disagree
/// about what "by artist" means.
