//! What a queue change costs in store edits, and the arithmetic a drag needs.
//!
//! Separate from the widgets because this is the half that can be tested
//! without a display — and because it is where issue #6 is actually won.
//!
//! **A rebuild always loses the scroll position. Every other edit keeps it.**
//! Measured on GTK 4.22, driving each edit programmatically with the viewport
//! parked 200 rows down and asking which row was on screen afterwards:
//!
//! ```text
//! remove one row        value 9553 ->  9505   one row's height    kept
//! move one row          value 9553 ->  9553   unchanged           kept
//! insert 30 at the head value 9553 -> 10993   30 rows' height     kept
//! remove 30 at the head value 9553 ->  8113   30 rows' height     kept
//! clear, then refill    value 9553 ->     0                       LOST
//! ```
//!
//! So [`plan`] exists to express *any* queue change as edits to the rows that
//! actually differ. Falling back to a refill is not a slower correct answer, it
//! is the bug. That is why the general case here is a splice over the changed
//! range rather than a rebuild: the ends of a queue are almost always untouched,
//! and trimming them is what keeps the edit small.
//!
//! The other half of #6 is not here, because it is not arithmetic: `GtkListView`
//! resets the scroll when the row holding **keyboard focus** is the one removed
//! or moved. See `components::drop_focus`.
