//! One row of the queue: a track, or the disclosure that hides the played ones.
//!
//! Two rules shape everything here, and both are the same rule twice.
//!
//! **A row never holds a position.** It reads `ListItem::position()` at the
//! moment something happens. A queue is edited in place, so surviving rows are
//! renumbered without being re-bound — an index captured at bind time quietly
//! starts naming a different track, and a drag then moves the wrong one. GTK
//! keeps `position` correct for exactly this reason.
//!
//! **Every handler is connected once, in `setup`.** They outlive every track
//! that passes through the widget, because none of them closes over anything
//! that changes: the position comes from the list item, and everything else
//! comes from [`Shared`]. That removes the whole class of bug the old row had to
//! defend against by disconnecting and reconnecting six handlers per bind.
//!
//! What `bind` does is therefore only drawing — and it sets **every** property,
//! because the widget it is handed was showing a different track a moment ago
//! and anything left alone keeps that track's value.
