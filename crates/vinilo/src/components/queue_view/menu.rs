//! A queue row's context menu.
//!
//! Its own menu rather than `app/row_menu.rs`, because a row in the queue is a
//! different thing from a row in a list: it is already in the queue, so
//! "Add to Queue" is meaningless and "Play Next" means *move this*, not insert a
//! second copy. The account actions are deliberately absent — a queue is a
//! running order, not a place to edit your library from.
//!
//! Built imperatively and per click for the same reason the library's is: a
//! `ListView` recycles the widget underneath the popover while it is open, so it
//! is parented, shown and unparented per click rather than living in the tree.
