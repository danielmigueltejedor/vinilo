//! What's playing next — MusicKit's queue, as a sidebar in the player drawer.
//!
//! **This is a projection** (CLAUDE.md rule 3). MusicKit owns the queue; every
//! act here sends a command and waits for the echo, and nothing on screen is
//! authored locally. The one exception is deliberate and lives in the app: a
//! drag moves the row optimistically, because a drop that springs back while a
//! command is in flight reads as a failure even when it worked.
//!
//! Three things that are not obvious, each of which has cost real time:
//!
//! * **The store holds only what is drawn.** No ids, no indices. Which track
//!   sits at a visible position is [`QueueView::rows`]'s question, rebuilt on
//!   every sync — see `row.rs` for why a row that remembers its own index
//!   eventually moves the wrong track.
//! * **Visible positions are not queue indices.** With the played tracks
//!   collapsed the list starts partway down, and the disclosure occupies a row
//!   of its own. Everything a row reports is a *visible* position, and
//!   [`QueueView::track_at`] is the only thing that turns one into a queue index.
//! * **The list is never rebuilt** (#6). See `reconcile.rs`.
