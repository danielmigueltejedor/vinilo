//! Keeping `~/.cache/vinilo/artwork` from growing forever.
//!
//! It is the last unbounded thing Vinilo writes: the Chromium cache is capped
//! and the library cache is one 430KB file, but every cover fetched for every
//! search anybody ever ran stays on disk. Measured at 973 files and 41MB
//! against a library that can only account for about 700 of them.
//!
//! **Provenance is not recorded, and deliberately is not going to be.** A
//! filename is a one-way hash of the URL, so the directory cannot say whether a
//! cover belongs to your library or to a search — but the *app* can, because it
//! holds the library. Deriving the keep-set at prune time beats tagging files
//! at write time for three reasons: a cover can be both (an album you own also
//! appears in search, and a tag would have to pick), it self-corrects when an
//! album leaves your library, and it can be counted before anything is deleted.
//!
//! **The cache is why the grids are fast** — #27 measured 520ms against 75ms,
//! and the win was covers already being on disk. So the keep-set prune only
//! runs when the directory is over its cap. What runs unconditionally is the
//! narrower sweep for files in shapes the app has stopped writing, which
//! nothing will ever read again whatever they contain.
