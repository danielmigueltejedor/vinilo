//! The picture on a tile or a page header — square for a record, round for a
//! person.
//!
//! Two widgets, one visible at a time, because **a round portrait is an
//! `adw::Avatar`**. The obvious-looking alternative does not work: `circular`
//! is a libadwaita *button* style and has no rule matching a `GtkImage`, so
//! there is no border radius for `overflow: hidden` to clip to and the portrait
//! stays square. Reaching for custom CSS to invent one would be the wrong call
//! twice over — CLAUDE.md asks for a libadwaita widget where one exists, and
//! `AdwAvatar` is exactly that widget. It also draws initials when there is no
//! picture, which is what a library artist with no catalog twin needs.
