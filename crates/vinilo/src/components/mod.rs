/// Take keyboard focus out of a list before its model is edited.
///
/// **This is issue #6, and its cause rather than its symptom.** `GtkListView`
/// throws the scroll position away when the row holding keyboard focus is the
/// one removed or moved — and clicking a row, or starting a drag on it, is what
/// gives it focus. Measured on GTK 4.22, driving identical edits with the
/// viewport parked 200 rows down:
///
/// ```text
///                              value          the row on screen
/// remove a row, nothing focused  9553 ->  9505   unchanged
/// remove a focused row           9553 ->     0   lost, ~50ms later
/// remove a focused row, focus dropped first
///                                9553 ->  9360   unchanged
/// ```
///
/// The delay is what made this so hard to see: for the first frame the
/// adjustment is *correct*, so every attempt to restore the value ran before the
/// collapse and corrected a number that was still right. And it is why
/// `set_focus_on_click(false)` on a row's own buttons never helped — the focus
/// that matters belongs to the `GtkListItemWidget`, which is GTK's, not ours.
///
/// The row is not re-focused afterwards. Restoring focus to a row is the very
/// thing that loses the position, and the act that got here was a click or a
/// drop, so the pointer is where the user's attention is.
