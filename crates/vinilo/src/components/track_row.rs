//! One row in a results list — a song, an album or an artist.

//! A `RelmListItem` over `gtk::ListView`, **not** a factory over
//! `gtk::ListBox`. A `ListBox` builds a real widget per row, so a 541-track
//! library meant 541 live rows. `ListView` recycles: it keeps about as many
//! widgets as fit on screen and rebinds them as you scroll.
//!
//! The consequence to keep in mind: widgets are **reused**. `bind` must set
//! every property it cares about, because the widget it is handed was showing
//! something else a moment ago, and anything left unset keeps the old value.
