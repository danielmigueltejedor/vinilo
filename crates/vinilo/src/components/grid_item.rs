//! Tiles for the Albums and Artists grids.
//!
//! The same shape as `track_row`, one dimension over: a `RelmGridItem` bound
//! into a recycled widget. All of that module's rules apply — **`bind` must set
//! every property it cares about**, because the tile it is handed was showing a
//! different album a moment ago.
//!
//! ## Artwork
//!
//! A grid is mostly pictures, and Apple gives us URL *templates* rather than
//! images. Fetching happens the only way it can here (rule 8, never block the
//! GTK thread): `bind` asks the app — through a callback — for the artwork, and
//! the app answers as a `Command` with pixels already decoded off the thread
//! (#27), repainting through [`ArtRegistry`] exactly as the play marker is.
//!
//! `bind` consults no cache of its own, deliberately. It used to, and the
//! decode it saved was the 2.5ms-per-cover one that froze the UI for half a
//! second per grid; the disk cache still exists, but it is consulted by
//! `artwork::fetch` on the worker, where paying for it costs nobody a frame.
//!
//! The consequence of recycling: a tile that requested art may be showing a
//! different album by the time the file arrives. The registry is keyed by the
//! artwork's own cache key, so a late arrival lands on whichever tiles are
//! showing that artwork *now* — or on none, which is correct.
//!
//! **Plural, and that is the fix for a bug that looked like flaky downloads.**
//! The registry used to hold one `Cover` per key, on the stated assumption of
//! "one key, one live tile". That is false twice over: a multi-disc set, an EP
//! beside its single, or a compilation give two visible tiles the *same*
//! artwork template and therefore the same key; and the three grids are
//! searched in order, so a still-bound tile in a grid the user cannot see
//! shadowed the visible one. Either way the second tile to bind took the map
//! entry and the first kept its placeholder until something forced it to
//! rebind — which reads exactly like an image that failed to load.
