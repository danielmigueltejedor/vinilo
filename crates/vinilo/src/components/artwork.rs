//! Album art: fetch once, keep on disk.
//!
//! Two reasons this caches to a file rather than holding bytes in memory:
//!
//! 1. **MPRIS needs a path.** `mpris:artUrl` has to be a `file://` URL — the
//!    GNOME Shell applet will not reliably fetch an `https://` one. M3 depends
//!    on this, which is why it is built now rather than alongside MPRIS.
//! 2. Apple serves artwork as a *template* (`…/{w}x{h}bb.jpg`), so we request
//!    exactly the pixels the widget needs instead of scaling a 3000px JPEG.
