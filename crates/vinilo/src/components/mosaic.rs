//! The 2x2 cover Vinilo composes for a playlist Apple sends no artwork for.
//!
//! Split from `artwork.rs` because it is the opposite job. Everything there
//! fetches, caches and decodes pictures **Apple sent**; this is the one place
//! the app draws a picture Apple did not — measured, both endpoints: a playlist
//! you made yourself carries no `artwork` object at all, and `music.apple.com`
//! composes the mosaic in its own web player.
//!
//! It still leans on `artwork` for the parts that are genuinely shared — the
