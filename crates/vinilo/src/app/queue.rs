//! **Most of what used to be here is gone**, and that is the point of the
//! split. Building the queue, healing one MusicKit refused, verifying it opened
//! on the right track, remembering dead ids, saving the session — all of it
//! belonged to whoever holds the sidecar, and none of it belonged twice. What
//! is left is the part that is genuinely this client's: which rows the person
