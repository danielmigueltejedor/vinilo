//! Staying connected to the daemon, and folding in what it says.
//!
//! This file used to supervise a child process. It does not any more: the
//! daemon owns the sidecar, because the Chromium profile lock says exactly one
//! process may. What is left is a socket that can go away — which is a smaller
//! problem, since reconnecting costs a connect rather than a Widevine boot.
