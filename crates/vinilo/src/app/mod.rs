//! Root component.
//!
//! Redux with a compiler: `AppMsg` are the actions, `update` is the sole
//! reducer, and the view is derived from `AppModel`. No I/O happens inline —
//! the sidecar's stdout is drained by a streaming relm4 `Command` so the GTK
//! main thread never blocks (CLAUDE.md rule 8).
//!
//! ## What lives where
//!
//! This file keeps the three things that have to be in one place — the model,
//! the messages, and the `Component` impl that holds `view!` and the reducer —
//! and nothing else. The work each message does lives in a sibling module, all
//! of them `impl AppModel` blocks, which a child module may write because it
//! can see its parent's private fields:
//!
//! | Module | Owns |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | [`view`] | which section is showing, and the three encodings of that |
//! | [`library`] | loading and filtering songs, albums, artists and search |
//! | [`queue`] | turning a click into a `setQueue`, and healing a rejected one |
//! | [`pages`] | the album / artist navigation stack |
//! | [`playback`] | pushing mirrored state to the bar, MPRIS, notifications |
//! | [`supervise`] | keeping the sidecar alive and folding in its events |
//! | [`status`] | what the pane shows when it is not showing music |
//! | [`chrome`] | the menu, its accelerators, and the first-run dialogs |
//! | [`source_login`] | catalogue sign-in window, matching Apple Music's |
//!
//! The split is by *what a thing does*, not by layer, so a change usually lands
//! in one file. The reducer stays here because it is the map from action to
//! work, and a map is only useful whole.
