//! What `init` connects once the widgets exist.
//!
//! Split out of `mod.rs` (#78), which CLAUDE.md says should hold three things:
//! the model, the messages, and the `Component` impl carrying `view!` and the
//! reducer. None of this is any of those. It is imperative wiring that the
//! `view!` macro has no form for — stateful menu actions, a breakpoint, a
//! scroll handler, a property the macro cannot set on a `#[local_ref]`.
//!
//! Each piece is a named function rather than one `wire everything` block, so
//! the reason each exists is attached to it. Several of them are load-bearing
//! in ways that are not obvious and cost real debugging when they were absent —
//! `library_list` in particular restores two properties whose loss looked like
//! two unrelated bugs.

    // ten-pixel measurement discrepancy in the detail page's layout. That
    // was real and irrelevant: a taller window simply put the last row above
    // the bar.

    // guessing at its height — which changes with the theme and the text
