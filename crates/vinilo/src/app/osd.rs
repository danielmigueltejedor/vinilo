//! The volume panel: what `Ctrl`+`Up`/`Down` shows you.
//!
//! Vinilo's shortcuts change its own desktop stream rather than the system
//! output, so the shell does not draw its OSD. The in-window control also stands
//! down on a narrow window, exactly when the shortcut is the only way to reach
//! it: five presses would change the volume by a quarter and show nothing (#120).
//!
//! **Raised by the keyboard and by nothing else.** Not by MPRIS — the Shell
//! draws its own slider, our window may not even be on screen, and an animated
//! panel in an unseen window holds the frame clock open, which is the whole of
//! #126. Not by dragging the slider either, because you are looking at the thing
//! that already moved.
//!
//! `.osd` is GTK's own — the same translucent panel the Shell uses — and it
//! brings every colour, in both themes. What it does not bring is a shape: it
//! stops at square corners, and no libadwaita widget exists for an OSD panel to
//! inherit a pill from. So `style.rs` carries one rule of two properties, which
//! is the argument that rule has to make.
