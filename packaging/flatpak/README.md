# Flatpak

Vinilo needs libadwaita ≥ 1.8 and GTK ≥ 4.20 — relm4's `gnome_49` feature —
which almost nothing ships yet. Debian stable, Ubuntu 24.04 and Fedora ≤ 42
cannot build it. A Flatpak carries the GNOME 49 runtime with it, so those same
systems can run it.

**Not for Flathub**, and not submitted there. This builds a bundle you install
yourself.

```bash
make flatpak          # build and install locally
make flatpak-bundle   # produces Vinilo.flatpak to carry elsewhere
```

The first build needs the toolchain, all of it from Flathub and none of it
needing root:

**Those are build dependencies.** Installing the finished bundle needs only
`org.gnome.Platform//49`, and `make flatpak-bundle` records Flathub inside the
bundle (`--runtime-repo`) so flatpak offers to fetch it. Without that flag the
install stops dead on a machine with no Flathub remote — which is every clean
machine, and none of the ones this was developed on.

```bash
flatpak install --user flathub \
  org.flatpak.Builder \
  org.gnome.Sdk//49 \
  org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.rust-stable//25.08 \
  org.electronjs.Electron2.BaseApp//25.08
```

## Files

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `dev.danielmiguelt.Vinilo.yml` | the manifest |
| `cargo-sources.json` | 489 crates by hash — generated, committed |
| `generate-sources.sh` | regenerates the above from `Cargo.lock` |
| `electron-shim` | puts zypak where it has to be |

Run `generate-sources.sh` whenever `Cargo.lock` changes. There is no npm
equivalent to regenerate — see below.

## Three things that are not obvious

**zypak wraps `electron`, not the app.** It has to be the *direct* parent of
the Chromium process, and Chromium is the app's grandchild: the launcher starts
the Rust binary, which spawns Electron. Wrapping the launcher leaves the sidecar
aborting on `chrome-sandbox … mode 4755` exactly as if zypak were absent, and
the supervisor restarts it for ever. So `electron-shim` stands where
`electron_binary()` looks and wraps the real binary beside it.

**No npm tree.** The sidecar's only dependency is Electron itself, and the app
runs `node_modules/electron/dist/electron` directly — the other thirteen
packages exist only to *download* that binary. So the castLabs release is a
single pinned archive rather than a generated node-sources list. Bumping
Electron means changing the URL and the `sha256` in the manifest, and nothing
else.

**The build is offline**, because `flatpak-builder` forbids network access
during a build. Every crate is declared with a hash up front.

## Permissions, and why

- `--share=network` — Widevine has no persistent licences on Linux, so playback
  needs a connection every time, and the CDM is fetched on first run.
- `--device=dri` — without it GTK renders in software and the grids scroll badly
  enough to read as a bug in the app.
- `--own-name=…` — Flatpak's bus proxy only lets an app own names matching its
  ID; without this `GtkApplication` cannot register and exits 0 with no window.
- **No `--filesystem`.** Settings, artwork cache, session and the CDM all live
  under the app's own directories.

## The CDM

It is fetched, not bundled — by Chromium's own component updater, into
`~/.var/app/dev.danielmiguelt.Vinilo/config/Vinilo/WidevineCdm/`. Nothing
proprietary is redistributed here: Electron is MIT, Vinilo is GPL-3, and the
CDM arrives on the user's machine through their own updater.

This was measured rather than assumed: Vinilo was run inside a real
`org.gnome.Platform//49` sandbox with `--nofilesystem=home` and a private `HOME`
carrying no CDM, and a track played. The original plan deferred Flatpak on the
grounds that a sandboxed component updater was "genuinely hard"; it is not.
