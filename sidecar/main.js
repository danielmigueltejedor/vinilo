// Vinilo sidecar — the invisible half of the app.
//
// This process exists for exactly one reason: Widevine. Apple Music full tracks
// are HLS + Widevine, and on Linux the only CDM that exists ships inside
// Chromium. So we run castLabs Electron, load the real music.apple.com in a
// window that is never shown, and drive MusicKit from Rust over stdio.
//
// The window is shown exactly once — for Apple's own sign-in — and then hides
// forever; the session cookie persists in the `persist:vinilo` partition.
//
// PROTOCOL: newline-delimited JSON.
//   stdin  <- commands from Rust   { id?, cmd, ...args }
//   stdout -> events to Rust       { event, ...payload }
//   stderr -> human logs (Chromium's own noise lands here too)
//
// *** NOTHING may write to stdout except send(). A stray console.log corrupts
// *** the channel and the Rust side will drop the connection. Use log().

// a separate app called "vinilo-sidecar" (from package.json's name), with a
